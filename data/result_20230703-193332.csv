This has significantly reduced the cost and single point of failures and has increased performance and scalability.
ETL is currently used for on-prem where the data is collected from different vendors, gets transformed using some business logic and then it is finally loaded in the data warehouse. Whereas ELT is used on cloud platforms where we collect the data from various vendors and store it into a cloud data warehouse and then transform the data on the cloud itself.
The main advantage of ELT over ETL is we can have unlimited access to all our data at any time. ELT also delivers faster data ingestion unlike ETL where data can be loaded and transformed simultaneously.What is DBT?In the ELT (Extract Load Transform) of data, the T is a crucial step as the transformed data is used by the business analysts and decision makers to get insights.
DBT is a data transformation tool that enables data/business analysts or developers to transform the data in the cloud data warehouse.
As we keep having lots of data now more than ever before and ELT being a new trend in town, there is a shortage of data engineers who can manage the data and make it accessible to use. Most of the data is not even analytics-ready and this is where DBT comes into play and makes the data transformation and analytics easier. DBT makes use of simple SQL select statements and effectively transforms the data using code. Anyone who has a basic understanding of databases and SQL can write such queries which would transform the data according to the business requirements.
DBT also allows one to test the data quality, documentation, and deployment along with the code. The ease of using this tool makes anyone with basic coding skills create data pipelines and therefore it reduces the entry barrier to this data world.
Some advantages of DBT:

Code Re-usability: With dbt one can write a model (SQL select statement which creates a table/view) once and then reference it within your other models. It also makes the code modular, we can re-use instead of re-code.

**Testing: ** With DBT, the testing of data quality becomes easier as alert our teams related to data quality issues as soon as possible. We can write tests like not null, unique, etc. to source and target tables/models.

**Speed: ** DBT makes the deployment and creation of models a lot faster. As our models are modular, we can create it once and reference it at other places, we are not executing the same code repeatedly and that saves lots of time.

Documentation: Dbt allows us to add descriptions of our created data models into the code.

How DBT helps organisations?DBT is the new hot data transformation tool that has been getting massive adoption by the organisations which deal with lots of data. It is contributing to the growth of such organisations in several ways:

Accessibility of ELT: With dbt, it is easy to make data transformation through code and with analysts having less knowledge of data engineering and basic knowledge of SQL it makes this ELT process very accessible and analysts can now also create such data pipelines as well.

Cloud Flexibility: DBT is designed in such a way that it can work with any cloud vendors like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc. and make transformations on the cloud data warehouse.

Documentation and Testing: The testing in DBT is easy and can be easily automated and any failure would also send alerts to the respective teams. Documentation is also generated by DBT automatically about various models, snapshots, tests, and dependencies.

DBT is Fast: DBT has a simple and efficient development style which is in combination with SQL statements and good practices which makes fast and reliable data pipelines.

Saves cost: As the data analysts with basic SQL can build data pipelines, it saves costs for organizations.

ConclusionFrom the above case study, it is quite clear that data will be more valuable than ever before and DBT is one of the most efficient tools present in the market that will help us in data transformation. Here at Gemini Solutions, we are making use of this new tool in many of our projects, and it is making data transformation easier than ever before.Explore by tagsTechnologyInfrastructureMost Viewed Case StudyThere are no more Trending Case Studies.SHAREAnmol RahejaCase Studies you may likeThere are no more Case Studies for this Cateory."

Gemini Solutions' privacy objectives also aim to be consistent with applicable international statutes.
Scope:
Gemini Solutions is committed towards protecting the privacy of the data which is in accordance with its Privacy Policy. In order to meet its privacy goals, Gemini Solutions has implemented various company policies encompassing privacy and security. These include Gemini’s Security Program, Information Security policies and the company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics. Gemini Solutions also implements agreements with vendors, customers and employees that protect non-public information, including non-disclosure agreements, protective commercial agreements, and data sharing authorizations (such as “direction letters”). Gemini has implemented various administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect private data against anticipated threats and hazards, and unauthorized access.Security MeasuresGemini Solutions takes reasonable steps to retain only such vendors and service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate security measures to protect non-public personal information. Such steps may include reference checks and using our internal audit and security teams to conduct onsite review of operations.Business Transaction with CustomersGemini Solutions from time to time receives/can access data from its customers (e.g., only for accessing the information with direct line via a Citrix connection) that contains information of the client elements, such as names, current shareholding, government-issued identifiers and operational reports from processes we are responsible to deliver. The terms and conditions applicable to each party’s responsibility with respect to such data are set forth in our commercial software licensing and services agreements, including terms relating to confidentiality, access authorization, technical safeguards, regulatory compliance, and loss management.Collection of Personal InformationGemini Solutions acquires employee private information in connection with performing the Human Resources function. All of this data is received when the employee is onboarded or as or when required. This information is included with job applications, employment eligibility forms, government personal data sheets, payroll instructions, and other employee forms; examples of this information include direct deposit account numbers, national insurance and names of emergency contact relatives, phone numbers, health reimbursement accounts, and benefits selections.
We also may occasionally receive information that could be considered medical in nature, although the primary communication channel for this data is between employees and our medical insurance providers and our benefits administrator service. Although an increasing amount of this data is electronic, much of this private information is still provided in paper form, which is stored in a locked records room. When collecting employee private information, Gemini Solutions provides notice and information to employees regarding the information being collected.Security of Information CollectedGemini Solutions takes appropriate measures to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access and disclosure. Through ISMS trainings and refresher course after 6 months we ensure that our employees understand the confidentiality of the data and that it is important to safeguard the information failing which Gemini Solutions reserves the right to take appropriate action against any employee who fails to adhere to the requisite standards of conduct.Notification of Changes to This PolicyThe management can change/alter this policy without any notice at its sole discretion at any point in time."

These data points are very scattered, not very useful to PMs/Analysts in the raw format, or at the company/issuer level. PMs/Research analysts want to view/compare these Metrics at the portfolio level, or benchmark level.Approach FollowedESG reporting via Power BI – ESG Data model built in Power BI to consolidate all the 800 odd ESG metrics

Carbon/Climate Report - One stop shop to all the Carbon/Climate related ESG Metrics, showcased at the security/portfolio level, for PMs/ESG Research Analysts/Credit Analysts to refer to. For example, one of the comparison in the report showcases the comparison of Weighted Carbon Intensity(which is the average of the issuer’s greenhouse emissions compared to its overall revenue - calculated in Power BI) at account vs. it’s corresponding benchmark, or for that matter any other benchmark(the PMs want to view)

Similarly this report showcases multiple comparisons utilizing these 100 odd Carbon/Climate ESG Metrics , and greatly assist PMs/Credit Analysts to perform Scenario Analysis(buying/selling securities, and the impact on the overall portfolio on say selling a security with High Carbon Emissions, replacing it with a security with comparatively low Carbon Emissions/FootprintChallenges One of the bigger challenges was how to handle the large data size in PowerBI, bringing together data for 600K odd securities across 800 odd ESG Metrics on a day in day basis. As per the Business ask, Data is run on a daily basis for 4 dates(Last Business Day, Last Month End, Last Quarter End & Year End).
Rather than fetching this huge chunks of data from On-PREM database sources, ultimately impacting the PowerBI performance, we adopted the approach to generate the data for the 4 dates through Python scripts. Four different files are created on a daily basis through these Python scripts, and the files are stored on Cloud. PowerBI then calls and fetches the data from these 4 files through API calls. The whole process of data ingestion is completely automated.Explore by tagsTechnologyInfrastructureMost Viewed Case StudyThere are no more Trending Case Studies.SHAREAnmol RahejaCase Studies you may likeThere are no more Case Studies for this Cateory."

Handling of complex and large data sizes.
Accurate data modelling in Power BI, as the data was being fetched from different data sources, some of them coming from on PREM databases, few of them were fetched over API calls.
Dashboard performance tuning was extremely important. Business needs to export data daily so data export and dashboard load should be relatively quicker.
Approach Followed
The first step is to gather the data from different data sources into Power BI.
CSV file upload (Data from Vendor) on Amazon S3 Bucket and then build python script and generate URL for reading this file. The URL (Rest API) is embedded in the m query and we fetch the data in Power BI.
Vendor data uploaded in Oracle Database and fetch the data using Local query in Power BI.
Reference Data from our firm already present the Oracle Data so we fetch using Local query as well.
Prepare the Data Model. The data size is large and comes from different data tables, so we need to prepare the model most accurately and we need to take circular dependency and ambiguity concepts.
Build the Visuals/Charts on top of that Data Model. We make Calculated Column and measure in such a way so that it would not impact on Dashboard Performance.

Benefits for BusinessIt is difficult for the Risk Managers to perform these liquidity stress tests, or analyze risk data manually, given the data complexity, and data being received from different sources The Liquidity Stress Test Power BI report/dashboard assists the Risk managers to analyze scenario’s like (Portfolio Behavior in Stress Scenarios, % Worst Flow, CVAR, Redemption Parameters, Transaction Level Data, illiquid Holdings, Liquidity Stress History, Different checks like Compliance LIQUIDITY CHECK and Vendor vs Firm Data), and help to raise any alerts in a timely fashion.Explore by tagsTechnologyInfrastructureMost Viewed Case StudyThere are no more Trending Case Studies.SHAREAnmol RahejaCase Studies you may likeThere are no more Case Studies for this Cateory."
