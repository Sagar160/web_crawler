# Web Crawler

A **web crawler**, also known as a **web spider** or **web bot**, is an automated program that systematically browses and extracts data from web pages. It begins with a starting webpage (seed URL) and follows hyperlinks on that page to discover and scrape content from other connected pages. Web crawlers are essential for building search engines, monitoring website changes, and performing data analysis.

## How This Code Works

The provided code is designed to scrape and extract information from the internet by following these steps:

1. **Extract the Webpage**  
   The crawler starts by fetching the content of a webpage using the provided URL.

2. **Collect All Links on the Page**  
   It identifies and collects all hyperlinks on the page. These links point to other pages that the crawler can visit.

3. **Extract Content**  
   The content of the current webpage is scraped and stored for further processing.

4. **Recursive Crawling**  
   The crawler recursively follows each collected link to visit and scrape connected webpages until all accessible information has been gathered.

This process creates a map of interconnected web pages, allowing the extraction of large amounts of data from websites.

## Use Cases for Web Crawlers

- **Search Engines**: Indexing web content for faster and more relevant search results (e.g., Google, Bing).  
- **Price Monitoring**: Tracking product prices across e-commerce platforms.  
- **Content Aggregation**: Gathering articles, news, or other specific types of content.  
- **SEO Analysis**: Analyzing website structures, links, and keywords.  
- **Data Mining**: Collecting datasets for machine learning or research purposes.
