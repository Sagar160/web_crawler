# Web Crawler

A **web crawler**, also known as a **web spider** or **web bot**, is an automated program that systematically browses and extracts data from web pages. It begins with a starting webpage (seed URL) and follows hyperlinks on that page to discover and scrape content from other connected pages.
## How This Code Works

The provided code is designed to scrape and extract information from the internet by following these steps:

1. **Extract the Webpage**  
   The crawler starts by fetching the content of a webpage using the provided URL.

2. **Collect All Links on the Page**  
   It identifies and collects all hyperlinks on the page. These links point to other pages that the crawler can visit.

3. **Filter Links with Keywords**  
   The crawler uses an array called `url_keywords` to filter the links. Only links that contain at least one keyword from this array are scraped, ensuring that the crawler focuses on relevant content.

4. **Extract Content**  
   The content of the current webpage is scraped and stored for further processing.

5. **Recursive Crawling**  
   The crawler recursively follows each collected link to visit and scrape connected webpages until all accessible information has been gathered.

This process creates a map of interconnected web pages, allowing the extraction of large amounts of data from websites.
