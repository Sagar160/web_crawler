       "       'An Overview of DBTAbout UsSolutionsTechnologiesGemUCareersContact Case Study > Technology > An Overview of DBTAn Overview of DBTMar 03 2023 |15 min readHow has ELT changed the data engineering world?In the past few years, organizations are migrating their on-prem data sources to cloud data sources. This has significantly reduced the cost and single point of failures and has increased performance and scalability.\\nETL is currently used for on-prem where the data is collected from different vendors, gets transformed using some business logic and then it is finally loaded in the data warehouse. Whereas ELT is used on cloud platforms where we collect the data from various vendors and store it into a cloud data warehouse and then transform the data on the cloud itself.\\nThe main advantage of ELT over ETL is we can have unlimited access to all our data at any time. ELT also delivers faster data ingestion unlike ETL where data can be loaded and transformed simultaneously.What is DBT?In the ELT (Extract Load Transform) of data, the T is a crucial step as the transformed data is used by the business analysts and decision makers to get insights.\\nDBT is a data transformation tool that enables data/business analysts or developers to transform the data in the cloud data warehouse.\\nAs we keep having lots of data now more than ever before and ELT being a new trend in town, there is a shortage of data engineers who can manage the data and make it accessible to use. Most of the data is not even analytics-ready and this is where DBT comes into play and makes the data transformation and analytics easier. DBT makes use of simple SQL select statements and effectively transforms the data using code. Anyone who has a basic understanding of databases and SQL can write such queries which would transform the data according to the business requirements.\\nDBT also allows one to test the data quality, documentation, and deployment along with the code. The ease of using this tool makes anyone with basic coding skills create data pipelines and therefore it reduces the entry barrier to this data world.\\nSome advantages of DBT:\\n\\nCode Re-usability: With dbt one can write a model (SQL select statement which creates a table/view) once and then reference it within your other models. It also makes the code modular, we can re-use instead of re-code.\\n\\n**Testing: ** With DBT, the testing of data quality becomes easier as alert our teams related to data quality issues as soon as possible. We can write tests like not null, unique, etc. to source and target tables/models.\\n\\n**Speed: ** DBT makes the deployment and creation of models a lot faster. As our models are modular, we can create it once and reference it at other places, we are not executing the same code repeatedly and that saves lots of time.\\n\\nDocumentation: Dbt allows us to add descriptions of our created data models into the code.\\n\\nHow DBT helps organisations?DBT is the new hot data transformation tool that has been getting massive adoption by the organisations which deal with lots of data. It is contributing to the growth of such organisations in several ways:\\n\\nAccessibility of ELT: With dbt, it is easy to make data transformation through code and with analysts having less knowledge of data engineering and basic knowledge of SQL it makes this ELT process very accessible and analysts can now also create such data pipelines as well.\\n\\nCloud Flexibility: DBT is designed in such a way that it can work with any cloud vendors like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc. and make transformations on the cloud data warehouse.\\n\\nDocumentation and Testing: The testing in DBT is easy and can be easily automated and any failure would also send alerts to the respective teams. Documentation is also generated by DBT automatically about various models, snapshots, tests, and dependencies.\\n\\nDBT is Fast: DBT has a simple and efficient development style which is in combination with SQL statements and good practices which makes fast and reliable data pipelines.\\n\\nSaves cost: As the data analysts with basic SQL can build data pipelines, it saves costs for organizations.\\n\\nConclusionFrom the above case study, it is quite clear that data will be more valuable than ever before and DBT is one of the most efficient tools present in the market that will help us in data transformation. Here at Gemini Solutions, we are making use of this new tool in many of our projects, and it is making data transformation easier than ever before.Explore by tagsTechnologyInfrastructureMost Viewed Case StudyThere are no more Trending Case Studies.SHAREAnmol RahejaCase Studies you may likeThere are no more Case Studies for this Cateory.',\n",

Gemini Solutions' privacy objectives also aim to be consistent with applicable international statutes.\\nScope:\\nGemini Solutions is committed towards protecting the privacy of the data which is in accordance with its Privacy Policy. In order to meet its privacy goals, Gemini Solutions has implemented various company policies encompassing privacy and security. These include Gemini’s Security Program, Information Security policies and the company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics. Gemini Solutions also implements agreements with vendors, customers and employees that protect non-public information, including non-disclosure agreements, protective commercial agreements, and data sharing authorizations (such as “direction letters”). Gemini has implemented various administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect private data against anticipated threats and hazards, and unauthorized access.Security MeasuresGemini Solutions takes reasonable steps to retain only such vendors and service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate security measures to protect non-public personal information. Such steps may include reference checks and using our internal audit and security teams to conduct onsite review of operations.Business Transaction with CustomersGemini Solutions from time to time receives/can access data from its customers (e.g., only for accessing the information with direct line via a Citrix connection) that contains information of the client elements, such as names, current shareholding, government-issued identifiers and operational reports from processes we are responsible to deliver.

       "       'Case Study > Technology > Make Data Useful for PMs and Research AnalystsMake Data Useful for PMs and Research AnalystsNov 10 2022 |7 min readProblem StatementThere are around 100-150 odd Carbon/Climate related ESG Metrics that are on-boarded via different vendor sources by ESG Tech, some of them calculated internally, available at issuer level. These data points are very scattered, not very useful to PMs/Analysts in the raw format, or at the company/issuer level. PMs/Research analysts want to view/compare these Metrics at the portfolio level, or benchmark level.Approach FollowedESG reporting via Power BI – ESG Data model built in Power BI to consolidate all the 800 odd ESG metrics\\n\\nCarbon/Climate Report - One stop shop to all the Carbon/Climate related ESG Metrics, showcased at the security/portfolio level, for PMs/ESG Research Analysts/Credit Analysts to refer to. For example, one of the comparison in the report showcases the comparison of Weighted Carbon Intensity(which is the average of the issuer’s greenhouse emissions compared to its overall revenue - calculated in Power BI) at account vs. it’s corresponding benchmark, or for that matter any other benchmark(the PMs want to view)\\n\\nSimilarly this report showcases multiple comparisons utilizing these 100 odd Carbon/Climate ESG Metrics , and greatly assist PMs/Credit Analysts to perform Scenario Analysis(buying/selling securities, and the impact on the overall portfolio on say selling a security with High Carbon Emissions, replacing it with a security with comparatively low Carbon Emissions/FootprintChallenges One of the bigger challenges was how to handle the large data size in PowerBI, bringing together data for 600K odd securities across 800 odd ESG Metrics on a day in day basis. As per the Business ask, Data is run on a daily basis for 4 dates(Last Business Day, Last Month End, Last Quarter End & Year End).\\nRather than fetching this huge chunks of data from On-PREM database sources, ultimately impacting the PowerBI performance, we adopted the approach to generate the data for the 4 dates through Python scripts. Four different files are created on a daily basis through these Python scripts, and the files are stored on Cloud. PowerBI then calls and fetches the data from these 4 files through API calls. The whole process of data ingestion is completely automated.Explore by tagsTechnologyInfrastructureMost Viewed Case StudyThere are no more Trending Case Studies.SHAREAnmol RahejaCase Studies you may likeThere are no more Case Studies for this Cateory.',\n",

Business needs to export data daily so data export and dashboard load should be relatively quicker.\\nApproach Followed\\nThe first step is to gather the data from different data sources into Power BI.\\nCSV file upload (Data from Vendor) on Amazon S3 Bucket and then build python script and generate URL for reading this file. The URL (Rest API) is embedded in the m query and we fetch the data in Power BI.\\nVendor data uploaded in Oracle Database and fetch the data using Local query in Power BI.\\nReference Data from our firm already present the Oracle Data so we fetch using Local query as well.\\nPrepare the Data Model. The data size is large and comes from different data tables, so we need to prepare the model most accurately and we need to take circular dependency and ambiguity concepts.\\nBuild the Visuals/Charts on top of that Data Model.
